# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — 13 August 2026

**Renamed from GRU953 Scribe to GRU953 Mukti** (মুক্তি, "freedom"). The app, the
command, the crates and the repository all follow.

This is a breaking change for anyone who installed 0.3.0: the command is now
`mukti` rather than `scribe`, and the crate names changed with it. Nothing
about the conversion changed — all 105 tests pass unaltered, and every accuracy
figure below is the same measurement as 0.3.0.

The brand kit's naming rule was amended rather than quietly broken. It required
"one plain, lower-risk English word"; it now also allows a plain Bangla word,
written in Latin script, where a product is made specifically for Bangla
speakers. The rule exists so a name survives translation — and for an audience
that reads Bangla, a Bangla word travels further than an English one.

## 0.3.0 — 12 August 2026

The first version you can actually install and use. 0.2.0 was a Rust library
with no window and no command; this is an app, a command-line tool, and an
accuracy figure that means something.

### New

- **A desktop app** for macOS, Windows and Ubuntu. Two panes, convert as you
  type, drag a file onto the window, light and dark. Its **Show what changed**
  view marks every word that was converted, so Mukti's judgement is something
  you can check rather than something you have to trust.
- **A command-line tool**, `mukti convert` and `mukti check`, for doing many
  files at once. It never overwrites your file unless you type `--in-place`.
- **Word, Excel and PowerPoint files** converted in place, with formatting,
  tables and pictures untouched. Includes SmartArt, charts, speaker notes and
  comments — all of which hold text people write and expect to be converted.
- **The brand's two typefaces are bundled** — Noto Sans and Noto Sans Bengali,
  under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. The app therefore looks the same on all
  three platforms, and Bangla renders even on a Linux install that ships no
  Bangla font of its own.
- **PDF**, read-only and best effort. Text is extracted and converted; layout
  is not preserved. Text drawn in fonts that store shapes rather than letters
  is skipped and counted, never guessed at.
- **Windows-1252 files are read correctly.** A Bijoy document saved as plain
  text almost never is UTF-8, and the glyphs Bijoy leans on sit exactly where
  the two encodings disagree. Previously such a file would not open at all.

### Changed

- **Detection is word by word, using context.** Previously a whole line was
  judged at once, so a line mixing an English heading with Bangla was
  converted or skipped as a whole. Recall on legacy words went from 39.7% to
  99.95% as a result.
- **A 451,348-word Bengali dictionary and a 234,428-word English one are built
  in**, replacing 150 hand-written word stems. This is what makes word-level
  detection possible: the question changed from "does this look like Bangla?"
  to "is this an actual Bangla word?".
- **Licence changed from PolyForm Noncommercial to MIT.**

### Accuracy

Every figure measured, with its sample size, and the detection figures taken
from a held-out half of the data never looked at during tuning:

| Measure | Result | Sample |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion, word accuracy | 99.989% | 473,244 words |
| Character grid, all conjuncts and vowels | 100% | 3,096 combinations |
| Detection, recall on legacy words | 99.951% | 154,928 words |
| Detection, false positives on English | 0.006% | 462,074 words |
| Detection, false positives on Unicode Bangla | 0.000% | 343,077 words |

### Known limitations

- **The installers are not signed.** Your computer will warn you the first
  time. Signing needs paid certificates from Apple and a Windows certificate
  authority, and neither is set up.
- **Older `.doc`, `.xls` and `.ppt`** cannot be read. Save as the newer format
  first.
- **PDF quality varies widely.** Measured across 60 legacy-font PDFs: 28 good,
  19 fair, 7 poor, 6 produced nothing.
- **The interface is English only.** Bangla is planned; every string already
  sits in one place so it is a translation rather than a rebuild.
- **One reported figure is not yet interpretable.** Converted words found in
  the dictionary, over real documents, sits at 78.4%. That is a lower bound —
  names and rare words are in no word list — and should not be read as an
  error rate until the residue has been sampled.

## 0.2.0 and earlier

A Rust library only: `convert`, `detect`, `convert_document`. No app, no
command-line tool, and an accuracy claim inherited from a single round-trip
measurement that could not be reproduced.
