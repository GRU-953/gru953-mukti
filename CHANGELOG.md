# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 12 August 2026

The first version you can actually install and use. 0.2.0 was a Rust library
with no window and no command; this is an app, a command-line tool, and an
accuracy figure that means something.

### New

- **A desktop app** for macOS, Windows and Ubuntu. Two panes, convert as you
  type, drag a file onto the window, light and dark. Its **Show what changed**
  view marks every word that was converted, so Scribe's judgement is something
  you can check rather than something you have to trust.
- **A command-line tool**, `scribe convert` and `scribe check`, for doing many
  files at once. It never overwrites your file unless you type `--in-place`.
- **Word, Excel and PowerPoint files** converted in place, with formatting,
  tables and pictures untouched. Includes SmartArt, charts, speaker notes and
  comments — all of which hold text people write and expect to be converted.
- **PDF**, read-only and best effort. Text is extracted and converted; layout
  is not preserved. Text drawn in fonts that store shapes rather than letters
  is skipped and counted, never guessed at.
- **Windows-1252 files are read correctly.** A Bijoy document saved as plain
  text almost never is UTF-8, and the glyphs Bijoy leans on sit exactly where
  the two encodings disagree. Previously such a file would not open at all.

### Changed

- **Detection is word by word, using context.** Previously a whole line was
  judged at once, so a line mixing an English heading with Bangla was
  converted or skipped as a whole. Recall on legacy words went from 39.7% to
  99.95% as a result.
- **A 451,348-word Bengali dictionary and a 234,428-word English one are built
  in**, replacing 150 hand-written word stems. This is what makes word-level
  detection possible: the question changed from "does this look like Bangla?"
  to "is this an actual Bangla word?".
- **Licence changed from PolyForm Noncommercial to MIT.**

### Accuracy

Every figure measured, with its sample size, and the detection figures taken
from a held-out half of the data never looked at during tuning:

| Measure | Result | Sample |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion, word accuracy | 99.989% | 473,244 words |
| Character grid, all conjuncts and vowels | 100% | 3,096 combinations |
| Detection, recall on legacy words | 99.951% | 154,928 words |
| Detection, false positives on English | 0.006% | 462,074 words |
| Detection, false positives on Unicode Bangla | 0.000% | 343,077 words |

### Known limitations

- **The installers are not signed.** Your computer will warn you the first
  time. Signing needs paid certificates from Apple and a Windows certificate
  authority, and neither is set up.
- **Noto Sans Bengali is not bundled.** The app uses whatever Bangla font your
  system has. macOS and Windows both ship one; a minimal Linux install may not.
- **Older `.doc`, `.xls` and `.ppt`** cannot be read. Save as the newer format
  first.
- **PDF quality varies widely.** Measured across 60 legacy-font PDFs: 28 good,
  19 fair, 7 poor, 6 produced nothing.
- **The interface is English only.** Bangla is planned; every string already
  sits in one place so it is a translation rather than a rebuild.
- **One reported figure is not yet interpretable.** Converted words found in
  the dictionary, over real documents, sits at 78.4%. That is a lower bound —
  names and rare words are in no word list — and should not be read as an
  error rate until the residue has been sampled.

## 0.2.0 and earlier

A Rust library only: `convert`, `detect`, `convert_document`. No app, no
command-line tool, and an accuracy claim inherited from a single round-trip
measurement that could not be reproduced.
